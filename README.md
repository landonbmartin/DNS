<h1 align = "center">Understanding & Building Intuition for DNS (Domain Name System)</h1>
This lab demonstrates the use of DNS and how to configure it. DNS serves as the phonebook of the Internet, translating domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load easy to understand Internet resources. To see how DNS works in practice, this lab follows up from the <a href = "https://github.com/landonbmartin/active-directory">installation and configuration of an Active Directory</a>. When configured and installed, we'll perform excercises with the Domain Controller and Client Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines in order to understand DNS better.
